        <p class="content-paragraph">
            Vallabhbhai Patel, in full Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel, also known as <b>Sardar Patel</b>, was born on October 31, 1875, in Nadiad, Gujarat, India. He was a prominent barrister and statesman, serving as one of the key leaders of the Indian National Congress during the country's struggle for independence. Patel played a crucial role as deputy prime minister, minister of home affairs, and more during India's early years post-independence.
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            Patel was a conservative and believed in practical approaches to governance. He opposed armed revolution, arguing for peaceful methods and cooperation with the British Commonwealth, provided that India was treated as an equal partner. His significant contributions include the peaceful integration of princely states into independent India.
